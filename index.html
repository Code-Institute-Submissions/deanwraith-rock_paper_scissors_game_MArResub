    <p>
      Rock, Paper and Scissors is played between two people,
      in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.
      Rock is a closed fist, Paper is a flat hand and Scissors is shown with a "V" made with
      the index and middle finger. Each round has 3 outcomes win, loss or draw depending on the
      select shape from each player.</p>
    <p>The adapted version of the game that includes 2 additional shapes which are Lizard and Spock
      was created by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla in the early 2000's. Lizard is made by forming a mouth
      with the hand and Spock is shown by making a the Vulcan salute from Star Trek.</p>
