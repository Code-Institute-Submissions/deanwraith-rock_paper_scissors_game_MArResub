The flexbox tutorial to style the summary section on the home page and the content of the Reuse, Reduce and Recycle pages. I also used the responsiveness tutorial to adjust the flexbox sections for smaller resolutions. Finally I code in thr forms tutorial to style my question form and adjusted it to fit what I required the form to show. I also used the responsive code for the form to function.
